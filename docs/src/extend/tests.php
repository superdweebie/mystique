    <p class="lead">One set of test data to rule them all</p>

    <p>When creating validators it's a <i>really really</i> good idea to write unit tests for them. All bundled validators use a common set of json formatted test data located in <code>mystique/common/testdata</code>. Contributions and improvements to this test data are much appreciated.</p>

    <h3>Javascript</h3>

    <p>The javascript test suite is located under <code>mystique/js/mystique/test</code> and uses the dojo's doh unit testing framework. If you have dojo and dojo/utils installed, then you can run the tests with <code>runTests.html</code>.</p>

    <h3>PHP</h3>

    <p>The PHP test suite is located under <code>mystique/php/test</code> and uses phpUnit.</p>
